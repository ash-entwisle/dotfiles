***Dear Hiring Manager,***

I am writing to express my interest in taking advantage of the Guaranteed placement roles offered. With a strong background in software development, proven experience in various technologies and a passion for innovation and exploration, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your teams. Ideally, I would like to work on campus for FOSE/ICTD as its geographical location is more convenient for me. Accomodation is easier to find, and is generally more affordable. I am limited when it comes to travel due to not being able to get a driving license due to my disability, so being on campus would make my life a lot easier, especially when it comes to commuting to work. 

At Lampada Digital Solutions, I am eager to leverage my skills in Python, C++, JavaScript, and many other programming languages and tecnologies to develop prototypes and proof of concept products. Both my experience gained through univerity and my experience as a Webmaster at HullCSS and various other projects has honed my ability to manage projects, onboard team members, and maintain production systems and remedy outages in a timely manner. I have a solid understanding of design patterns and algorithms and data structures and am able to apply it to create efficient and scalable solutions to complex real-world problems. 

In addition to my technical skills, I am well-versed in AGILE/SCRUM methodologies and have successfully led teams in designing, developing and deploying proof-of-concept projects for university and real-world systems. My proactive approach and strong organizational skills enable me to meet tight deadlines and deliver projects on time. 

For the Role in FOSE/ICTD at the University of Hull, my educational background in Computer Science and my practical experience in developing and deploying applications make me a strong candidate. I have a track record of creating robust solutions in a variety of programming languages and frameworks. I am familiar with the ins and outs of the software development lifecycle and have experience working in collaborative environments.I have over 5 years of experience with linux, and use it daily both in my personal and professional life. My work on projects such as Netter! and OpenBot demonstrates my ability to develop, test, and deploy software in a collaborative environment, ensuring that products are robust, scalable, and user-friendly.

Throughout my education and various projects, I have demonstrated excellent problem-solving capabilities, a keen attention to detail, and a commitment to delivering high-quality results. I am confident that my skills and experiences align well with the requirements of both positions, and I am eager to bring my expertise to your teams.

For references, you can reach out to either Dr Jamshed Iqbal ([j.iqbal@hull.ac.uk](mailto:j.iqbal@hull.ac.uk)) and/or Mr Aren Marsden ([me@arenmarsden.com](mailto:me@arenmarsden.com)). Jamshed is my personal supervisor at university, and I have worked with Aren on many projects over the past 2 years. Both can attest to my technical skills, work ethic, organization and planning skills, and ability to work well in a team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can contribute to these roles.

***Kind regards,***
